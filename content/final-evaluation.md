## Description

Integrating ScanCode toolkit as a new agent to FOSSology. Using the command line interface from the scancode package in order to be called right from the fossology application. Fossology is passing a single file and takes the result for <code style="color:rgb(14, 149, 233);font-size: 1em;">license/copyright/author</code> from the scancode command line call.

### Video Demonstration

### Working

- Scancode is a parametric agent which can provide information regarding license, copyright, Email, and URL information separately or all together.
- When a user uploads a file, Scheduler passes a single file and takes the result for license/copyright/author from the scancode command line call. These results are stored in the FOSSology database depending upon the kind of result.
    - Licenses are stored in the license_file table based on the agentId, pfileId, and rf_fk.
    - New licenses are inserted into the license_ref table.
    - Highlight table is used to save highlight info.
    - There are scancode_copyright and scancode_author tables to save scancode findings for copyright and Author respectively. Also, both have event tables to store scanner deactivated statements.
- These data are rendered on UI in respective fields:
    - For license information check License Browser.
    - For Copyright information check copyright tab.
    - For Author information check Email/URL/Author tab.


### Challenges

- Understanding existing codebase for such a large project, I had to make changes in new code as well as existing code so understanding code and making changes and debugging that was quite challenging.
- Working on a full stack project, I had to learn new tech-stack quickly to complete task before deadline. 


### Learnings

- Worked on a full stack project.
- Got to learn so many new tech- stack like PHP, Rest API, Database, Docker, OOPs (Full of learning).
- Got chance to improve my communication skills.
- Learned how to work and interact in a community.
- Got chance to interact with peers, mentors.


### How to test

- Fetch [sarita/newagent/scancode](https://github.com/itssingh/fossology/tree/sarita/newagent%2Fscancode) on your local by using command <code style="color:rgb(14, 149, 233);font-size: 1em;">$ git fetch https://github.com/itssingh/fossology sarita/newagent/scancode:scancode</code> and checkout to the <code style="color:rgb(14, 149, 233);font-size: 1em;">scancode</code> branch.
- [Install FOSSology from source](https://github.com/fossology/fossology/wiki/Install-from-Source)
- Upload a file from Source/URL/VCS then select license or copyright under scancode-toolkit.

    *NOTE:* Email and URL are not working for now as scancode-toolkit doesn't provide this info by using a custom template ([PR](https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/pull/2539) is merged waiting for new release ðŸ¥³ ).

    - Check license browser/license single file view for license information.
    - Check copyright bulk view or copyright single view for copyright information.
    - Check author/email/URL bulk view.

- If you are facing a problem in installing scancode, please install the scancode-toolkit manually. The steps to [install scancode-toolkit](https://github.com/itssingh/fossology/wiki/scancode#the-steps-to-install-scancode-toolkit)
